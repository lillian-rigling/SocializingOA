<h2> Project Mission and Summary </h2>
 Weâ€™re creating resources for and working with humanities researchers and educators to find ways to integrate open practices into their workflows and articulate the value of humanities work so that educators and learners can have better access to the breadth of extant and emerging humanities research.

<h2> Milestones </h2>

<h3> Objective 1: Inspire people with stories about the need for better open access in the humanities. </h3>

<h4> Tasks </h4>
<ul> <li> Collect 5 stories from educators, learners, and researchers about the need to open their research. </li>
  <li> Write 5 blog posts about the stories </li>
  <li> Reach 1k people with these stories on Twitter" </li>
</ul>

<h3> Objective 2: Gather a useful, timely, and relevant collection information into a research hub to help researchers open up their research. </h3>

<h4> Tasks </h4>
<ul> <li> Create Gitbook webspace for the collection of information </li>
<li> Organize the information we've collected into bite-sized chapters that are useful to different key personas we've identified </li>
  <li> Track usage and uptake of Gitbook, aiming for 10 commits and 10 user stories. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Contributor Guidelines </h2>
 
We are currently looking for assistance in the following spaces:

<ul> <li> Are you a humanities researcher looking to open up your research? </li>
